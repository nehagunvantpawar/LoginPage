# LoginPage
Create a simple sign, signup, and profile page using the t3 stack, and implement password-based authentication using NextAuth.js, Prisma, and Postgres. Show the user's email and name on the profile page. The design of pages will not be considered for the evaluation, hence you can submit a basic layout.
